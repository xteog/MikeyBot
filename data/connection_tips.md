# To test and improve connections:
1. Use an ethernet cable (NEVER Wifi or Hotspot) directly into modem.
2. Turn off other devices on same internet.
3. Close Voice Chat in Discord.
4. Play in window mode not full screen.
5. Close other apps on computer.
6. Do not livestream or record your race.
7. Get a internet upgrade or use a desktop/more powerful computer

8. Unique issue: if you experience screen stutters while playing (even offline) it may be a blue-tooth interference if you are on a wireless controller, disconnect bluetooth and try again.
