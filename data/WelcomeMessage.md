# NEW DRIVER INFORMATION
Welcome in our UR2D community!
## What do I do if I'm new here?
Get yourself settled in!
- Go to https://discord.com/channels/449754203238301698/867770874207928372 to let people know your nationality and preferred pronouns.
- Then, use [Speedcheck](https://speedcheck.org) to test your connection. Take a screenshot and post it in https://discord.com/channels/449754203238301698/930047083510132746.
- Finally, go to https://discord.com/channels/449754203238301698/938881795120840774 and give a little bit of info about yourself (how much time you’ve spent playing UR2D1/UR2D2, when you first started playing the game, if you’ve played other similar games etc).
## How can I go racing?
**Apprentice League (AL)** is our 4th tier of racing, and happens on **Sundays at 15:45UTC**.
**This is the perfect entry level league, that only needs a connection check and a Steam Id verification. Contracts are not necessary, just race!**
## What else is on offer?
We run many other leagues during the week. Each weekday league has its own style - if you’ve got a fun idea, suggest it! We’re always looking for new ideas for competitions we can run.
Additionally, you’ll often find people practicing their skills in random multiplayer races. They’ll usually send out a message in https://discord.com/channels/449754203238301698/903892486399868978, so keep your eyes peeled on that if you want to get involved in some racing!
## What if there aren’t any lobbies up?
Time trial is a great way to improve your skills at the game. We mainly use Formula eSports cars (in our races, so choose one of those cars, pick any track you like and get practicing!)
Once you feel you have a good time; send a screenshot of the time trial leaderboard to https://discord.com/channels/449754203238301698/703949403073019974 and impress everyone!
Don’t worry if you don’t feel fast at first! We all started out that way, and just a little bit of practice will massively improve your speed!
